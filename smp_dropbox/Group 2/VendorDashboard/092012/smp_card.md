# SMP Cards
The purpose of the SMP Cards is to allow for further content discovery from within blog posts as well as outside websites where a vendor may embed a copy of their cards linked back to Style Me Pretty and Little Black Book. The SMP Cards should be attached to blog posts and be easily recognizable as such. It could even be a featured advertisement inside a blog stream.

This work is an enhancement to the basic business card concept addressed earlier and as such I did not include an opt out for the vendor as we currently do not have an implementation of the business card. In essence, it would replace it.

### Description

The SMP Cards consist of the following parts:

* SMP branding, linked back to either SMP or LBB homepages.
* Favoriting link
* Listing Avatar, linked back to listing page.
* Listing Name, linked back to listing page.
* Listing short description.
* Content (updated photos, blog posts, galleries and videos) featured in SMP posts and galleries or uploaded by the vendor.
* link to more related content.
* Links to listing page, vendor galleries, blog posts and testimonials.

### Workflow


The workflow for the SMP Cards should be kept as simple as possible with the static content generated from the listing profile (avatar, name, description) and the content being provisioned based on the vendor's choice of either blog posts, photos, galleries or videos. There could also be an option for either latest content category, random or possibly contextually-related content.

1. The vendor arrives at their dashboard, defaulting to the listings view
2. The vendor clicks on the provided "View SMP Card" link
3. The vendor is shown the SMP Card view in its current configuration (showing posts, photos, galleries or videos)
4. The vendor can then change the content slection via radio buttons that will update the SMP Card to reflect the new configuration state
5. The vendor can also generate embed code by selecting their desired width, copying the code via highlighting or assisted Copy button and pasting their code into an HTML page hosted by a third party.
6. Vendor can return to the Listings page at any time via a link located directly below the Vendor Vanity component.
