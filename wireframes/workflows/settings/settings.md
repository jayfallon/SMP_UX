# Settings Workflow

The settings workflow relates to the multiple actions and sub-workflows that can be initiated by the member on their settings tab inside the member dashboard.

### Settings Initializing

Once a member has [successfully registered an account](https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/blob/master/wireframes/workflows/membership/membership_success.md) with SMP the only attributes they will have populating their settings profile will be:

* username
* email address
* password

Subsequent to registering their account, the new member will be prompted to visit other parts of the SMP website, one of them being their dashboard. Upon arrival at their dashboard view, the user will be visually alerted that they have additional settings to configure:

* avatar (image)
* name (input:text)
* wedding date (input:text)
* wedding location (input:text)
* newsletter (checkbox:button)
* privacy (radiobutton:button)

Even though the member has met the minimal requirements for operating an account, it would benefit the SMP community if the member would configure their additional settings. These can be done all at once or one at a time according to the member's needs.

The following is a walkthrough of the different individual workflows pertaining to those additional settings.

#### 1. Avatar

The member avatar workflow should be as easy as possible. The member has to simply click on the current avatar to trigger a file modal window to open in the browser, select the image they want and activate the saving process returning them to their default view.

#### 2. Name

The member types their name into the username input field and activates the saving process returning them to their default view.

#### 3. Wedding Date

The member focuses inside the Wedding Date field and a javascript date/picker should appear allowing the member to visually select their desired date. They can also enter their own date via keyboard but the date format must be consistent with the date/picker format. The member then activates the saving process and returns to their default view. Should the member only select to define their wedding date, the "in" separator between wedding date and wedding location should not appear.

#### 4. Wedding Location

When the member focuses inside the wedding location input field they can enter their location manually and activate the saving process returning them to their default view. Should the member only select to define their wedding location, the "in" separator between wedding date and wedding location should not appear.

### Additional Settings Workflows

#### 8. Change Password

In order for a member to change their password, they will have to activate the edit state for settings and subsequently activate the change password workflow by pressing the Password Change button. At this point, three cnventional methods can be employed, each with its own drawbacks.

#####  8.A New View

Once the member has activated the change password workflow, the server would return a new view containing minimal SMP branding and a form containing three fields (old/current password, new password, password confirm). The memeber fills out the fields correctly, submits the form and the server returns them back to the dashboard view. Should the member fill out the form fields incorrectly or the server not validate their new password, the member would be engaged in a validation loop.
