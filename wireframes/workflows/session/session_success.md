# Session Success

In order to successfully Sign In to an SMP member account, a user must first provide valid username and password credentials. Once the member has provided their valid credentials, the server shall return the user to the same view they signed in on with a change in the user bar from a signed-out state to one indicating a signed-in state by substituting the Sign In button with a Username button and no longer displaying the Register button.

### Sign In Workflow
