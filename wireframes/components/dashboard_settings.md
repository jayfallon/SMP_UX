The dashboard settings view for a member will have the following components:

* Avatar
* Name(s)
* Username
* Member Email address
* Member wedding date and location
* Profile Settings button
* Newsletter Subscription button
* Privacy Settings button
* Password Change button
* Account Deletion button

#### Avatar

<a href="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/settings/settings_avatar.png"><img src="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/settings/settings_avatar.png" width="600" height="140" /></a>

The member avatar is used to visually identify the member wherever they create content across the SMP website. The member avatar can be either a user-provided image, and SMP-provided image or could be an image pulled from the member's Gravtar account should SMP allow access to the Gravatar API.

The member avatar will also be visible on the member's page as well as on the member's button on the user bar at the top of every view when the member is logged in.

The member avatar should be large enough to be visually appealing to both the member and the visitor as well as proportionate to the website layout.

The member's avatar should be editable and once a new image selection is provided by the member it should be updated accordingly wherever the member's avatar is displayed.

Image cropping/resizing functionality should be provided by SMP in order to assist the member in determining their preferred image but all member avatars should be of the same size.

#### Name(s)

<a href="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/settings/settings_name.png"><img src="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/settings/settings_name.png" width="600" height="140" /></a>

The member name should be prominent on the setting tab and allow for easy identification of the member. 

The member should be able to edit their name to accommodate for names that require more than two fields. I would recommend having just one field for the member name. 

#### Username

<a href="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/settings/settings_username.png"><img src="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/settings/settings_username.png" width="600" height="140" /></a>

As the member's username is set from the registration workflow and is immutable, it is best displayed within the context of how it works inside the SMP website, as a URL. The member's username is also prominently displayed on the member's button in the user bar at the top of each view where the member is signed in.

Should the member possess a profile page accessible by other users and members, the username on the settings tab should be linked to that profile page.

#### Member Email address

<a href="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/settings/settings_email.png"><img src="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/settings/settings_email.png" width="600" height="140" /></a>

The member's email address should be displayed in the settings tab and should reflect the address that the member is employing in all SMP communications and password recovery. Alongside the email address there should be an explanation that the address itself is not visible by other users and members.

#### Member wedding date and location

<a href="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/settings/settings_wedding.png"><img src="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/settings/settings_wedding.png" width="600" height="140" /></a>

The member will have the option to set their wedding date an location. Should the member opt not to enter this information or does not pertain to them, it should be left blank and not appear on the member's profile view.

The component should consist of a heading along with two fields:

* wedding date
* wedding location

Each of these fields should have a on-focus activation of a visual assistant. The first field a calendar, the second a city/state locator.


#### Profile Settings button

<a href="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/settings/settings_profile_button.png"><img src="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/settings/settings_profile_button.png" width="600" height="140" /></a>

A profile settings button should be located on the settings tab at the top of the right-side as a header for the functional component. By activating the Profile Settings Edit button, a member should be able to edit all mutable fields in their settings along with activating the Newsletter, Privacy, Password and Account buttons.

Once the member has concluded their edits, the Profile Settings button will serve as their Save button.

#### Newsletter Subscription button

<a href="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/settings/settings_newsletter_button.png"><img src="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/settings/settings_newsletter_button.png" width="600" height="140" /></a>

The Newsletter Subscription button is inactive until enabled by the member via the profile settings button. Once active, the member can choose to either subscribe or unsubscribe to the SMP newsletter.

#### Privacy Settings button

<a href="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/settings/settings_privacy_button.png"><img src="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/settings/settings_privacy_button.png" width="600" height="140" /></a>

The Privacy Settings button is inactive until enabled by the member via the profile settings button. Once active, the user can select to have their profile displayed at public or private with other members being able to access their Inspiration Boards, Favorites and Comments.

#### Password Change button

<a href="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/settings/settings_password_button.png"><img src="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/settings/settings_password_button.png" width="600" height="140" /></a>

The Password Change button is inactive until enabled by the member via the profile settings button. Once active, the member can select the button to initiate the password change workflow.

#### Account Deletion button

<a href="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/settings/settings_delete_button.png"><img src="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/settings/settings_delete_button.png" width="600" height="140" /></a>

The Account Deletion button is inactive until enabled by the member via the profile settings button. Once active, the member can select the button to activate the account deletion workflow.
