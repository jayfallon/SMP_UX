# Vendor Profile

The Vendor Profile represents the view that the vendor has inside the Little Black section of the SMP website.

The Vendor Profile view is comprised of seven distinct sections with three of those sections further linking to additional content related to the Vendor on separate views.

The sections that I will describe on the Vendor Profile view are as follows:

* LBB Header
* LBB Navigation
* Profile Vanity
* Profile Information
	* Key People
	* Contact Information
	* Vendor Location
* Profile Posts
* Profile Gallery
* Profile Testimonials

Additional views related to the Vendor that can be accessed from the Vendor Profile view are:

* Vendor Posts
* Vendor Gallery
	* Galleries View
	* Gallery View
* Vendor Testimonials

A sub-view consisting of a basic vendor information will be made available for use throughout the SMP website and referred to as the Vendor Business Card.

The LBB Header, Global Navigation, LBB Navigation, Profile Vanity and Profile Information will be present on all vendor profile views and thus do not have a secondary enhanced representation.

### LBB Header

</a>

The header employed for the LBB section of the SMP website is divided into three distinct sections and is displayed on all LBB-related pages.

On the left-hand side we have a small SMP logo linked directly back to the SMP home page (http://www.stylemepretty.com). Directly below the SMP logo there is room for promotion.

In the center we have a large LBB logo (TBD) that is linked directly to the LBB homepage (http://www.stylemepretty.com/little-black-book/).

On the right-hand side we have the user bar at the top displaying the current user's avatar and name along with HElp and Quickboard links. If a user is not logged in, links for Register and Sign In will be displayed.

Below the user bar we have the search component. The social media icons for SMP can be added or we can have unique ones just for LBB.

Directly below the top section we have the SMP global navigation (Inspiration, Real, LBB, DIY, Local) which link directly to their respective section in the SMP website. Absent a LBB logo or particular branding in the center top portion of the header, the LBB link in the global navigation would be set to be current with a dark background and white text.

### LBB Navigation

<img src="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/vendor_profile/vendor_nav.png" width="600">

</a>

The LBB navigation consists of a breadcrumb section on the left and user action section on the right.

The breadcrumbs provide a navigation component for the LBB by displaying Region, Location and Vendor Type which create a mental model for the user to navigate the LBB. The breadcrumbs are not dynamically generated but have assigned variable to each vendor. The breadcrumbs can also be configured to include html Select components to further ease LBB navigation.

On the right-hand side we have icons with possible user actions for:

* Favoriting: when a user favorites a vendor, the vendor's business card is added to the user's favorites, located in their dashboard, for future reference.
* Recommending: if a user wishes to provide a testimonial for this particular vendor, we should offer them a small interface to do so.
* Sharing: a user should be able to share the vendor's URL and basic information via email or other sharing options.

### Profile Vanity

<a href="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/vendor_profile/vendor_vanity.png">

<img src="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/vendor_profile/vendor_vanity.png" width="600">

</a>

The profile vanity section consists of a vendor avatar, vendor name and a description of the vendor's services.

The vendor's avatar is an image with a width of 200 pixels and no set height so that the vendor can add images without cropping.

The vendor's name is displayed boldly at the top of their content and is linked directly to their profile view (example: http://www.stylemepretty.com/little-black-book/holmanranch or http://holmanranch.stylemepretty.com)

For certain vendors, a link titled "Premier Destination Wedding Vendor!" s present but is linked directly back to the vendor's web site. Should this not be linked to a section under the LBB listing all premier destination vendors?

Below the vanity head we have descriptive text provided by the vendor. The vendor should be able to this text at will and the limits on the amount of text should be liberal as it does not affect the page layout. Vendors will find a sweet spot for content length as they're able to compare with others.

### Profile Information

<a href="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/vendor_profile/vendor_info.png">

<img src="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/vendor_profile/vendor_info.png">

</a>

The vendor's profile information is located in the view's sidebar and occupies it in its entirety. The profile information section is further subdivide into three separate modules which are displayed independently and are not required to be displayed in the view should they not be necessary.

The placement of the modules is interchangeable and subject to testing but I wanted to reinforce the people aspect of the business with the key people at the top.

#### Key People

<a href="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/vendor_profile/vendor_key.png">

<img src="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/vendor_profile/vendor_key.png">

</a>

The key people section lists those agents of the vendor who would be most likely to interact with the prospective customer and includes their business contact information. This configuration allows for the vendor to add multiple points of contact associated with a name and a face.

In the case that a key person is also a member of SMP, a link to their dashboard would be provided.

In the case where a key person does not have an avatar a blank should be provided for them.

An example of a key person would include an avatar uploaded by the vendor directly or supplied via their dashboard avatar, the agent's name, phone number(s), email address(es) or other preferred method of communication.

#### Contact Information

<a href="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/vendor_profile/profile_contact.png">

<img src="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/vendor_profile/profile_contact.png">

</a>

The vendor's contact information can consist of multiple entries for distinct services or points of contact of the vendor's choosing.

Examples of contact information can be web URLs, phone numbers, email addresses or other links to preferred method of communication.

#### Vendor Location

<a href="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/vendor_profile/vendor_location.png">

<img src="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/vendor_profile/vendor_location.png">

</a>

The vendor location section can accommodate maps to display the location of a venue or the area where a vendor is willing to perform their services. Multiple entries can be accommodated for different vendor types and needs.

### Profile Post

<a href="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/vendor_profile/profile_post.png">

<img src="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/vendor_profile/profile_post.png" width="600">

</a>

The profile post section contains one SMP blog post (minus comments and business card) that features the vendor. This can be configured to be the latest post or a post of the vendor's choosing.

As posts can be rather long, I would limit it to one. Should the vendor not have a blog post featuring their work or choose not to display a blog post, this section can be hidden from view. Posts should be linked back to their original display in their SMP blog.

The profile post section should contain links to the Vendor Posts page if required.

### Profile Gallery

<a href="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/vendor_profile/profile_gallery.png">

<img src="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/vendor_profile/profile_gallery.png" width="600">

</a>

The profile gallery is used to showcase work via images or video that the vendor uploads or links to externally (youtube or Vimeo). It would be in the interest of SMP to establish guidelines of how the work is displayed, working to maximize the available layout space while maintaining SMP-level of quality.

In this example I'm displaying two 900-pixel wide images. Vertical images would need to be displayed side-by-side in pairs to maintain consistency. A board would probably one solution or the view could display icons for galleries. This approach would save load time on the profile but would hide vendor work from view and require an additional click by the user to access.

All photos in the profile gallery should be linked back to their respective vendor gallery and there is a link to the all of the vendor's galleries view should there be more than one.

Should the vendor choose not to display a gallery the section should be hidden from view.

### Profile Testimonials

<a href="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/vendor_profile/profile_testimonials.png">

<img src="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/vendor_profile/profile_testimonials.png" width="600">

</a>

The profile testimonials section displays the latest testimonials that the vendor has been able to garner from users, clients or associates. The testimonials should be displayed at the choosing of the vendor but in a limited set for the profile view with a link to all of the vendor's testimonials in its own view.

A good testimonial would consist of an avatar for the user, their name, and a quote provided from the testimonial.

## Vendor Posts

<a href="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/vendor_profile/vendor_posts.png">

<img src="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/vendor_profile/vendor_posts.png" width="600">

</a>

The vendor posts page consists of the same layout as the vendor profile view except that the content consists exclusively of posts featuring the vendor that they choose to display.

Due to the size and length of some of the blog posts, I would limit the number to be displayed at a maximum of three, without comments or business cards and linked back to their original location in their respective SMP blogs. Since the vendor would have control of which posts to display and when to display them, I would not encourage displaying entire posts on their own in a separate vendor view as links to those views could not be guaranteed as they are on the SMP blogs.

----

## Vendor Gallery

Views under the vendor gallery section consist of the same layout as the vendor profile view except that the content consists exclusively of galleries featuring work that the vendor has uploaded.

The vendor gallery consists of two separate views:

### Galleries View

<a href="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/vendor_profile/vendor_galleries.png">

<img src="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/vendor_profile/vendor_galleries.png" width="600">

</a>

The galleries view lists all of the vendor galleries available for viewing. By clicking on one of the gallery icons, the user is shown a the particular gallery in a separate view.

### Gallery View

<a href="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/vendor_profile/vendor_gallery.png">

<img src="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/vendor_profile/vendor_gallery.png" width="600">

</a>

The gallery view displays any number of images that the vendor has uploaded and assigned to the gallery.

The user should be able to perform all actions on these images as they do with the other images in the SMP content stream (share, favorite) and even build a board with them.

The galleries should be laid out in the same fashion as the board are to achieve consistency with SMP.

----

## Vendor Testimonials

<a href="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/vendor_profile/vendor_testimonials.png">

<img src="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/vendor_profile/vendor_testimonials.png" width="600">

</a>

The vendor testimonial page consists of the same layout as the vendor profile view except that the content consists exclusively of testimonials provided by users, clients and associates of the vendor and should be of the vendor's choosing.

----

### Vendor Business Card

<a href="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/vendor_profile/vendor_business_card.png">

<img src="https://github.com/stylemepretty/UX/raw/master/wireframes/components/vendor_profile/vendor_business_card.png" width="600">

</a>

The vendor business card is a combination view of the vendor vanity and contact information that can used throughout the SMP website to link back tot he vendor profile view. It can be consistently displayed in a post, dashboard or shared via email.

The vendor business card consists is modular and should work at various widths without any modification. It consists of the vendor's avatar, vendor name linked back to their profile page, a short description and a contextual link back to their profile. A favorite button should be located on the business card enabling the user to save directly to their dashboard favorites.

Should be enable social following features, a follow button can be added to the avatar.
