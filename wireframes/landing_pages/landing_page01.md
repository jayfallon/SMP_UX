# Landing Pages

Just a quick mockup of a landing page suited for converting prospects to members of SMP.

### Components

For the landing page I've incorporated five separate components:

* Branding
* Messaging
* Product
* Social Proof
* Call To Action

#### 1. Branding

The branding is rather simple and clear consisting of the SMP logo displayed at the top of the page. The logo should be linked back to http://stylemepretty.com

#### 2. Messaging

The messaging consists of a simple tagline to get the user's attention with a message of promise towards what SMP will do for them.

Directly below is brief descriptive text explaining what SMP is and what type of services are offered. Links to other parts of the site (blogs, vendor guide, look book would be appropriate)

#### 3. Product

What better description than to let the product speak for itself? All images linked to blogs, boards, galleries.

#### 4. Social Proof

While "as featured in" pieces are sort of lazy, they do provide the user with almost instantaneous recognition of the value that the product has in the marketplace.

This social proof is reinforced by personal testimonials from other users.

#### 5. Call to action

The call to action is highly-visible, unambigious and centered in the user's line-of-sight. IN this case it's a link to a sign-up page. In an even simpler incarnation it could be just a form to collect their email address to commence the registration loop.
