# Category Pages

A simple mock up for category pages.

How do I get to this page? My assumption would be that by either search engine result or clikcing on a link to an internal page that lists Weddings and has them broken down by location. This is not a blog page, it is not an application page and it is not a LBB page.

### Components

For the category page I've incorporated seven different components:

#### 1. Standard Page Header

As seen on all pages of the SMP website with same functionality.

#### 2. Page Heading

Denotes the current location-based section the user is browsing. Upon change of location it would read Parent > Child > Grandchild in breadcrumb fashion with links back to previously viewed pages in the same stack.

#### 3. Location Navigation

The navigation in the sidebar would be aligned vertically and upon activation of a link would show the user a subsection of the parent. For example if a user clicked on the menu link titled Santa Barbara the view would change to a URL of .com/weddings/california-weddings/santa-barbara and the content would reflect all content associated with Santa Barbara.

The space underneath the navigation can be used for promotion, advertisement or features.

#### 4. Page Intro and Description

Short text description and filtering device to allow users to automatically filter vendor-centric content (links to vendor profiles) via category and location. Upon submission of the filtering form, the user would be presented with a list of vendors from their specified category(s) and location(s) from the vendor guide.

#### 5. Categories Listing

All categories listed that are available in the particular location/region which the user is currently browsing.

#### 6. Latest location media.

Visually descriptive links to the latest images, boards and videos created from location-tagged content. All links go to the appropriate content in SMP galleries, blog posts or vendor galleries.

#### 7. Latest Blog Content

This section features the latest blog content from SMP, Real Weddings, LBB Blog and DIY and can be categorized as such with links back to the individual content and blog/section indexes.
