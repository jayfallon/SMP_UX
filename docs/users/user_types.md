# User Types

### User

A User is any person who accesses the website, regardless of their login state, membership status or role at SMP. In essence, any person accessing the website or interacting with any of its components is a User.

The default Role of a User would be one where their permissions allow them to create a photo board and share this board via an SMP-provided URL.

### Member

A Member is any person who has registered an account with SMP. 

The default Role of the Member would be one where their permissions allow them to edit, delete or otherwise modify their account and existing content in addition to sharing their content via the social media network of their choice.

Additional Roles can be assigned to a Member or revoked at any time.

### Editor

An Editor is any person employed by SMP who has a registered account with SMP.

The default role of an Editor would be varied on the tasks assigned to them but would allow them access to the Wordpress Dashboard where they could create, edit, update and publish content to the SMP website.

### Admin

An Admin is any person employed by SMP or agent thereof whose role(s) allows them to edit, delete, publish or otherwise interact with third-party content or accounts on SMP.

Admin Roles would be varied depending on the tasks assigned to each Admin, from creating and publishing content on the SMP blog(s) to User administration.

#### Roles

Roles are permission sets that can be created and assigned/revoked to any User account which would allow said User to interact with the entirety or parts of the SMP applications in order to perform CRUD tasks.
