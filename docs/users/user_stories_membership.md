# User Stories for Membership

## User

The following stories are related to any User who has yet to acquire Member status or whose current login state is Signed Out.

A User accesses the website via http and is able to consume content (text and photos) of interest by either entering the web address of the website in the URL bar of their browser or through a direct link provided by an external party such as a search engine, publisher or fellow user.

A User is subsequently able to browse additional content of the site not displayed on their original view via links embedded in the page.

While browsing the site, a User may come across content that they deem of interest and would consider sharing said content with third parties. The User should be able to easily access a human-readable URL in the URL bar of the browser or have ready access to a direct URL to the content provided by SMP.

In the case of browsing the photographic content of the website, should the User locate content of interest, they should be able to easily mark (favorite) this content for inclusion to a photo board with a default layout. A visual cue to the user must be provided alerting them to the existence of a default-style photo board, the number of photos currently included and a direct link to the photo board which can be accessed by either the current User or other Users that they have shared the board's URL with. Only one board can be created at a time by a User.

Once a User has started the process of creating a board they will be given the opportunity to name said board and claim ownership of the board with their email address. One the User confirms via email that they are indeed the owner of the photo board, they have become a Member and will be granted those permissions by which they can edit, modify or delete photos included in the board or add additional photos at any time.

_TEL: I love the simplicity of this.  Any concern about spamming? I could create a board full of porn and send it to any email address in the world and it would be associated with SMP_

Additionally, at any time and on any view of the SMP website, a User can easily register to become a member of the site with the ability of returning to the view they were browsing, continuing to a view of their Dashboard or Help via their own choice. The registration process should be streamlined to only require an email address with the confirmation being provided by the User through their email account.

Where opportunity arises, a User can convert themselves to a Member once they've supplied SMP with an email address. This can be achieved through any marketing activity, a flash sales component, etc. and should be consistent across SMP on how the process works.

_Really like the idea of acheiving some consistency here._

_TEL: I really want to encourage people to tell use when something is wrong.  Occasionally things break and no one tells us.  Worst feeling in the world._

## Member

The following stories are related to any User who has acquired Member status or whose current login state is Signed Out.

Any Member can have the same access to all of SMP's content as a User while Signed Out of the application. A Member can access and consume all content on the site, can create a default board by favoring items and share that board via an SMP-supplied URL without ever actually providing an email address or logging in. Once a Member favorites their first item, they will be prompted to name their board and to provide their email address. They can skip either item yet if they do provide an email address, a password input should appear and the user can sign in to the application at this point and continue their browsing experience uninterrupted. On-screen visual notification should appear signaling to the Member that they have an unfinished board under construction with a direct link to that board under the Inspiration Boards tab in their Dashboard view.

_Right now favorites and boards are not tightly coupled (unlike pinterest)._

Additionally, a member should be able to sign in to the application via clicking a link located at the top-right portion of their view. Once a user clicks the link, they should be prompted with a form where they can enter their email and password, submit the form and return to the page they were initially browsing prior to signing in. A visual indicator will now replace the sign in link with a message alerting the user that they have signed in. For future consideration, an indicator that an activity related to their account has occurred should also be located alongside the signed in indicator.

Where opportunity arises, a Member should be afforded the same sign in process on other SMP related activities that do not pertain to the website, such as marketing activity. The sign in process should be universal across all SMP properties and be single sign on (SSO).

_Love the idea of a single sign on._

Should the Member access the website without the intention of signing in, they should be able to able to access the exact same content and perform the same tasks as those of a User (listed in the User section of this document). In those cases where the Member is unaware that they have not signed in, they should be prompted to do so in order to save any potential work to their account yet in a manner that does not interfere with their workflow.

#### Member Stories

The following stories are for Members whose status is Signed Out:

* As a Member I would like to access the SMP website without signing in.

* As a Member I would like to favorite items without signing in and have those items serve as the basis for a default photo board.

_Really cool idea._

* As a Member I would like to be supplied with a URL for my default board and be able to share that board without signing in or having my SMP credentials attached to the default board.

* As a Member I would like to be prompted to rename my default board and provide my email address to do so.

* As a Member, I would like SMP to recognize my membership status should I enter my email address and prompt me to login.

* As a Member and having supplied my email address to SMP for the purpose of claiming my photo board, should I decline to sign in, I would like to be notified of the implications yet not impeded from sharing the URL of the board and not have SMP making any claims of the board for me.

* As a Member I would like to provide my sign in credentials via link at the top every view of the SMP website which I may encounter while my current status is Signed Out.

* As a member I would like the Sign In process to unobtrusive and easy to use by providing my email address and password and being redirected to the view I was browsing with my status changing to Signed In.

The following stories are for Members whose status is Signed In:

* As a Member, I would like to visual see a change in my Signed In status welcoming me back to SMP.

* As a Member, I would like to see that I have direct access to my Dashboard and a visual indicator alerting me that some third-party interaction has occurred with my account.

* As a Member I would like to have the functionality at any time to change my status to Signed Out.

* As a Member having changed my status to Signed Out I would like to be redirected to the view I had been browsing unless it was a view that required my status to be Signed In in which case I would like to be either redirected to the main SMP  blog page or a landing page for another SMP property/offering.

* As a Member I would like to see a visual indicator once I have changed my status to Signed Out and return to the default signed out view. 


_Over all, looks really good. I'm slightly confused about how favorites relate to photoboards when the user is signed out.  Let's talk about it. Thanks Jay!_
