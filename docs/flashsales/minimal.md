# Infrastructure Options for a Flash Sales System

### Minimal Option

In the minimal option approach, SMP would take those steps necessary to implement a system closely associated with the SMP brand yet offloading most of the responsibility to the product or service provider. This would incur minimal implementation on behalf of SMP's technical team, project management, creative team and support.

The following responsibilities represent those incurred by both Provider and SMP for a purchase in a minimal implementation.

#### Provider responsibilities

* Inventory verification
* Advertisement Provisioning
	* Media
	* Text
	* URL's
* Advertising placement (provider-owned properties, network)
* Product page
* Shopping cart
* Purchase order fulfillment (payment transaction/refund, shipping, tracking, notifications, returns)
* Customer service


##### Inventory verification
The provider would be responsible for providing proof that the items they are promoting for sale on the SMP do in fact exist in a quantity that would satisfy SMP supply requirements for the particular sale. Some sales will be of declining inventory stocks ("while supplies last"), some will be aggregated sales orders ("ships in 4 to 6 weeks"), others will be reservation-based sales (package deals) and yet some will be voucher-type sales where the provider can offer discounts on future sales. At a minimum, a contract should be in place that would guarantee product/service delivery as well as the honoring of reservations, coupons or other vouchers within a specified time period.

##### Advertisement Provisioning
The provider would be responsible for providing all advertisement materials to include media, product/service description and appropriate URL's used for the sole purpose of promoting the specified product/service. These materials would be industry-compliant as well as appropriate for the SMP network in content and purpose.

##### Advertising placement
Should the provider desire to further promote their sale through a third-party not affiliated with SMP, they would be responsible for the costs, content and product/service availability above and beyond the amount negotiated with SMP.

#####Product page
The provider would be responsible for the provision of a web page detailing the product/service offered for sale to the SMP network which would include appropriate media, contextual descriptions, the terms of sale and a method by which the user can choose to make a purchase.

##### Shopping cart
The provider shall be responsible for the provision of a secure e-commerce solution that would allow for product/service purchasing. This solution should not only be able to perform financial transactions between the SMP network member and the provider but also allow for purchase confirmation, refund confirmation, delivery tracking and disseminate any notifications on behalf of the SMP network member.

##### Purchase order fulfillment
The provider would be responsible for the actual procurement, shipment and delivery of any physical purchases as well as the administration of any reservations, coupons or vouchers which require no physical possession on behalf of the purchaser.

##### Customer service
The provider would be responsible for guaranteeing a minimal customer servicing level to purchasers that could include assistance via email, online chat or telephone. The purpose of this customer service would be to assist purchasers with any difficulties that may arise due to shipping, payment or procurement errors. The customer service level provides to purchasers by the provider on behalf of SMP should be at a level where SMP can avoid a situation similar to that of the [Avenger Controller](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/paul-christoforo-ocean-marketing-emails).

#### SMP responsibilities

* Vendor sourcing, recruitment and qualification
* Inventory verification
* Advertisement content review and approval
* Flash Sales system promotion
* Advertisement placement (SMP-owned properties, network)
* Feedback collection and analysis


##### Vendor sourcing, recruitment and qualification
SMP would be responsible for the sourcing, recruitment and qualification of all providers invited to joined the provider program. This would ensure that no third-party vendors would be participating in the program without SMP approval and would facilitate the subsequent recruitment of additional providers into the partner program in addition to the vendor guide. I would imagine that this process would be somewhat similar to SMP's current vendor vetting process yet not as strict nor would it incur any up-front payments to SMP other than a potential surety bond.

##### Inventory verification
SMP would have to ensure that the inventory for sale actually exists, can be procured within reasonable amount of time or that guarantees at the time of purchase will be honored by the provider. For a minimal implementation, a contract would have to suffice.

##### Advertisement content review and approval
SMP would have to review all materials pertaining to the advertisement (media, text, terms) and approval of those materials for deployment to the network. This would include the product page as well.

##### Flash Sales system promotion
SMP would be responsible for the actual promotion of the existence of the Flash Sales system to the network via blog postings, newsletter articles or social media dissemination prior to the launch of the actual system. This would educate the network on the workflow, expectations and purpose of the system. For a minimal implementation, a simple beta test would be ideal yet not required.

##### Advertisement placement
SMP would be responsible for the placement and dissemination of all advertisement throughout SMP-owned properties to include the SMP website, newsletter, social media accounts and any third party networks deemed necessary to assist in the promotion.

##### Feedback collection and analysis
Should SMP desire to collect feedback from the network regarding the Flash sales workflow, transaction, customer service and overall experience, they would need to engage an independent service or expand their current contact process to include the Flash Sales system.

#### Conclusion

This minimal implementation covers the very basic needs to get a Flash Sales system deployed on the SMP network and would be optimal for large, well-known partners who have not only an independent, qualified sales network in place but also a level of experience that would be comfortable handling a user base the size of the SMP network.

This implementation would be less than ideal for smaller providers who do not have a dedicated sales and customer service team or system in place.

##### Drawbacks

The main drawbacks that I see from this approach would be the reliance on the provider to provision the product page and shopping interface along the reporting of sales analytics and being ultimately responsible for customer service.

SMP would have no control over the product branding/advertisement outside of its own network nor would they have complete control over the product offering.

SMP would have to rely upon provider for any sales data and payment as negotiated with provider.

SMP would have to rely on solicited feedback from the network as well as interface any customer service resolutions with the provider.

This implementation leaves open many chances for the creation of errors, misunderstandings and subsequent damage to the SMB brand, not to mention the potential for a poor experience that could hamper further sale opportunities or initiatives.

##### Benefits

It's cheap. SMP would set a minimal baseline of requirements and be able to source a large number of vendors who could meet them. SMP would be required to supply at a minimum one dedicated sales resource, one part-time technical resource and a very low engagement from the creative team, most likely on a once-a-week basis.

SMP would also be required to deliver the most basic technical development whose costs could be easily absorbed into the existing budget and would not require any long-term development on behalf of the SMP technical team.
