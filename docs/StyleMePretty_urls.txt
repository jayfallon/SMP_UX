key

~ = paginates
x = photos only 
+ = posts only
^ = videos only
# = photos videos posts
N = page needs to be built (no existing version of this page at all)
U = page look and feel needs to change (above and beyond the header)

Strategy
--------
* paginated pages not good landing pages (direct to higher level landing pages)
* pages for search should have obvious titles
* find similar ways to display similar items (photos, videos, posts) on different pages
* Can we use parts of our current design until we get new pages built?
* Design first or new content first?

Todo
----
* Mark new pages to build.
* Find examples of context sensitive navs that are good. 

Decisions
--------
Context sensitive menus?
same header through out

Top Level
---------
* front page
** weddings N
** shop 
** vendors U
** gallery 
** local  U (footer + show local blog posts on front page?)
** fashion U
...
** magazine
** events U
** search 
** login / dashboard

Issues (i.e. where do we put the following things?)
------
Magazine (in header)
Videos (somehow in galleries? seems like a bad idea)
Events (could be in header)
...
Search ~#
Login / User Dashboard
Little Black Book Blog (links on front page and on Little Black Book page. None in the header?).
DIY
color palettes (under "weddings" page?)
tags and categories (???) - have a blogs page.  Also show all tags and categories.

Wordpress (how to fit these things in?)
---------
* /2011/  ~x
* /2011/01/  ~x
* /category/wedding-style/ ~x
* /tag/california/ ~x
* /categories/ N (list all categories on a page. Only useful if you want to cut out categories listed in the sidebar).  - Posts by: Categories | Tags | Archives
** are fall weddings, modern weddings, loft weddings, vintage weddings categories?
* post page x

What are tags and what are categories?
--------------------------------------
* tags - vendors, venues, locations  (b/c there are so many of each of these things). -  can't tell what is a venue, vendor or location...using this. 
* public cats - seasons, styles, settings, diy, colors, inspiration - can have a list of top level categories...
* private cats - little black book blog, sponsored? 
Categories allow for better semantics...
Not worth cleaning up tags now?
Pretty easy to switch tags to categories later?
Most venues and vendors have exactly one domain.  Adding a tag just helps show people all posts by that vendor (why not switch out featured pages? and venue landing pages?)

categories - SMP Blog Posts Organized by...
----------
seasons 
styles
settings 
url: /category/settings/

I wish
------
I realy wish we could build a page that showed just posts or everything.  

Weddings  (between 3 and 7 new page templates => 20 new pages)
--------
* /weddings/  N (seasons, settings, styles) - could promote a tour too.  might be fun to make this page interactive.  Seaon style settings dropdowns?
* /weddings/styles/ N (list all styles)
* /weddings/styles/rustic ~# N
* /weddings/seasons/ N
* /weddings/seasons/fall ~# N
* /weddings/colors/ (later?) N
* /weddings/posts/ N (links to tags and categories) ?

Where can you find more key words that map to good pages that you can build?  How can we promote these pages?  Should we let people "follow" these pages on FB and twitter?

Ideas
-----
Limit public facing post "categories"?  Only show semantically friendly ones that we can organize around keywords?
* styles
* settings
* seasons
* colors	
This would allow us to replace the category list on the "real weddings" page with our new hierarchy of seasons, styles and settings. 
** right now we get posts on resource pages via tags...

keywords (think up some more)
--------
weddings
wedding vendors
destination weddings
wedding blog
