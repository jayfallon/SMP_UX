# Vendor Portfolio Pages

The following document describes how the new vendor portfolio pages will look and function.

### What is a vendor portfolio page?

A vendor porfolio page is a page located inside Style Me Pretty's Little Black Book section (vendor guide) that acts as a showcase for our vendors to present their work, client testimonials and contact information. Our goal is to have all of your vital information displayed on one single page.

### Minimal Version

At a minimum, the vendor portfolio pages will consist of short section containing all of your contact information (business name, ). We expect to be able to pre-populate this content on your portfolio page based on the information that you have already provided to Style Me Pretty.

We would like to further enhace your portfolio page by providing direct links to your website, blog or other social media presence right from one location.
