	.postContent.profile_text Cuteness alert!! Have you ever, ever seen the groom singing and playing the guitar while his bride-to-be walks down the aisle? Oh my goodness, it is just about the sweetest, most romantic gesture I’ve seen at a wedding. And trust me, I’ve seen a lot! Seaglass Cinema totally captures the romantic essence that is this couple. And can I just say, their day couldn’t have been any more gorgeous!

	.postContent.profile_text From Seaglass Cinema… Don’t underestimate the simple guitar track that opens this video. If you keep listening and watching, you’ll soon see what makes this the best soundtrack we’ve ever included in a video. This is no small claim, but trust us. We think you’ll agree. Shau-Ru and Ed were married at the gorgeous Holman Ranch in Carmel Valley. Shau-Ru’s creativity and elegance graced every detail, while Ed’s goofball demeanor really gave way to the hopeless romantic that he is on the inside. All in all, it was a beautiful day filled with love and faith.
